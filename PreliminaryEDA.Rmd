# Front Matter

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
# clean up workspace environment
rm(list = ls())

# all packages used for the assignment

# Guiding Question (Research Question)



# Acquainted with data sources

Where did you find them?
Who collected/maintains them?
When & Why were they originally collected?
What does a case represent in each data source, and how many total cases are available?

# Intuition related to the research question

```{r}
demographic_20172018 <- read_dta("demographic_20172018.dta")
druguse_20172018 <- read_dta("druguse_20172018.dta")
demographic_20172018 %>%
  group_by(seqn) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(dmdfmsiz))
```

# Two Data Sources

### Primary data

### Other data sources
